Feature: Integrate with online office suites like Collabora and OnlyOffice
  As a user
  I want to work on different docs, sheets, slides etc.., using online office suites like Collabora or OnlyOffice
  So that the collaboration is seamless
  # To run this feature we need to run the external app-provider service along with wopi, OnlyOffice, Collabora services
  # This is a minimal test for the integration of ocis with different online office suites like Collabora and OnlyOffice

  Background:
    Given "Admin" creates following users using API
      | id    |
      | Alice |
    And "Alice" logs in
    And "Alice" opens the "files" app

  Scenario: create an OpenDocument file with Collabora
    When "Alice" creates the following resources
      | resource         | type         | content              |
      | OpenDocument.odt | OpenDocument | OpenDocument Content |
    And "Alice" creates a public link creates a public link of following resource using the sidebar panel
      | resource         | role     | password |
      | OpenDocument.odt | Can edit | %public% |   
    And "Alice" logs out
    And "Anonymous" opens the public link "Link"
    And "Anonymous" unlocks the public link with password "%public%"
    Then "Anonymous" should see the content "OpenDocument Content" in editor "Collabora"
