Bugfix: Preview app files visibility

We've fixed the issue with displaying hidden files when user open a file in preview app in "Shared with me" list.
The `q_share-visibility` query param is now passed to the app so that if a user opens a file while listing "visible shares", the preview app will allow moving only to another visible files.
When the `q_share-visibility` query param is set to `hidden` (i.e. user is listing "hidden shares"), the preview app will allow moving only to another hidden files.
