Enhancement: Control more elements visibility via URL query

We've added new params into the URL query that allows configuring elements visibility. The following params can be used:

- `hide-app-switcher`: hides the application switcher in the top bar
- `hide-account-menu`: hides the feedback action, notifications bell, and user menu
- `hide-navigation`: hides the navigation sidebar and mobile navigation
